<h1>ðŸš€ Typescript Data Structure Implementation<h1><h3>This repository is used as my personal playground and experimation space for practicing Typescript and implementing Data Structures.</h3>
</p>
Please be cautious when reviewing or using any of the code within this repository, I often update, change, break, and try to optimize it beyond reasonable means. I'm really just using this space to grow my personal knowledge on the Typescript language and how Data Structures work prior to attending college.
